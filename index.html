                            <p class="small"><br>I really like the design of the products that Nest makes, and their dedication to being a design-oriented company.</p>
                            <p class="small">
                            However, the Android app, although pretty well designed, isn’t consistent with the rest of Android and Google’s material design guidelines, despite being a Google company themselves.
                            </p>
                            <p class="small">
                            Nest’s Android app allows the user to check and maintain their nest products, the thermostat and Nest Protect (the smoke and carbon monoxide detector.)
                            </p>
                            <p class="small">
                            When doing this visual redesign I kept careful attention not to radically change the design to the point where it was a completely new app, but rather to make smaller more subtle changes in order to make the app more consistent with the rest of Android as well as all of Google’s own Android applications.</p>

                                The first part that I redesigned was the app’s icon. Although the icon isn’t bad, it doesn’t fit well with the rest of Android and Google’s guidelines in style as well as the size of the icon itself.
                                </p>
                            <p class="small">
                                Redesigning the icon involved subtle changes such as changing the size of the square to be more consistent with Google’s other Android apps, as well as slightly adjusting the colors and drop shadow.

                            <p class="small">
                                When the app is signed in for the first time, it gives the user the option to add their Nest devices to the app, logically the first thing that should be done.
                            </p>
                            <p class="small">
                                In addition, I’ve kept the little marker at the bottom to “Learn More” in case a user wanted more information.
                            </p>
                            <p class="small">
                                This screen is mostly the same as it is in the current Android app, with the main differences being little ones to make it fit Android better. The font has been changed to the stock Android one, Roboto and the menu icon has been changed to the same one that most other Material apps use. In addition, I have replaced the realistic cloud image at the top. Instead, I made a noisy and cartoonish graphic in the same style as the ones that are often in many of Google’s other apps, such as Google Now and Google Calendar.

                                After signing in, the user is presented with the home screen.

                            <p class="small">
                                In addition to changing the top graphic, I chose to use the “cards” element found in many of other Android apps such as Google Keep and Play Music to represent the different added devices. The main menu has also been redesigned to fit the typical Android Style, and overlays the main app rather than pushing it out of the way.
                            </p>
                            <p class="small">
                                In contrast to the current Android app, I have switched the positions of the temperature and menu icons (the menu is now on the left). This allows for more consistency and a more native feel.

                                Pressing on a certain thing (the upstairs icon in this case) would open it up. This screen shows the status of the thermostat, using a larger version of the cards from the home screen. At the top right corner is the Thermostat’s menu.

                                Protect has been redesigned in a similar way. The main screen for the Nest Protect gives an indicator as to the status of the thermostat and its functionality. Below that are indicators for the status of specific locations. These are put outside of the card because they serve as additional information to the card, rather than an essential part of the card itself.

                                The Message and Protect History screens have also been visually redesigned in order to fit the rest of the app and Material Design better.

                                I hope that you have appreciated my redesign concept. Although I do understand that Nest, although integrating with Google, prefer to make sure that they keep their product base separate, it is still very important that they (and all app developers for matter) take note of the Material Design guidelines for Android when developing.

                                Making sure that Android apps feel native typically does not require massive changes to the UI but rather subtle ones. These changes make the application visually and interactively fit in better with Android. This gives the app a more native and polished feel, and demonstrates that the developer has a commitment to supporting Android users. Android apps that don’t fit in visually or look like iOS apps usually give the impression that Android users are being considered as an afterthought, rather than a priority.

                          <p class="small">I was a a director of the Cal Hacks 2.0 team, which organized the largest hackathon ever at over 2300 people.</p>
                          <p class="small">As the Director of Design for Cal Hacks 2.0, my first task was to redesign the logo for the next year. There was a request to keep it similar to the logo from last year, but show that there was some "evolution" in between.</p>
                          <p class="small">My first major concept came from keeping the exact same shape/etc. as the pixelated logo from the previous year, but then making it look "low-poly" instead of pixelated, much like the transition from older pixelated games to early 3d games.</p>
                          <img src="img/calhax/ch0.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                          <p class="small">However, this concept got mixed responses from the rest of the team. Many wanted to keep the previous "pixelated" style, leading to many variants on the previous logo until we ended up settling on this one:</p>
                          <img src="img/calhax/ch15.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                          <p class="small">Although popular, many concerns were brought up that the logo did not have enough "character" or "personality," which led to this complete 180 variant that focused primarily on cuteness and customization:</p>
                            <img src="img/calhax/ch1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p class="small">This bear was popular because it took care of the problems with the previous one. However, many felt it did not look "tech" enough and lacked the technical feel the original logo did. After our former director brought up an idea to check out the graphics from Maple-Story and recreate this logo in a high-res but pixelated form, sitting on a bench in front of a Trader Joes in the Mission District in San Francisco, I cranked out the first outline of what would become our final bear/logo and representation for Cal Hacks 2.0:</p>
                            <img src="img/calhax/ch2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p class="small">This logo proved to be a great success, and unfortunately for me, many members of the team wanted their own variants of the bear, giving me a lot of extra pixel-art work.</p>

                            <p class="small"><br>I came by to Startup Weekend Garden Grove. As an attendee who was only there for the first day, I was able to help out a potential startup with the designs for their app. Because I was only there for a bit and the developers wanted to get to working on the app concept as soon as possible, it was important that the mockups were created quickly. The total process, including sketching out UI designs and interaction patterns and then making the in Sketch took about 5 hours total. The UI mockups were made using parts from Invisions wonderful <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/do">Do</a> templates.</p>

                                The logo concept was picked by the rest of the team after a few initial concepts. Because the app primarily focused on a friendly travel experience, something along those lines was preferred. The logo consists of a "map marker" with a smiley face on it, as well as a second marker in the background to represent the the "Us" part of the app.

                                The iOS App Icon was made to be consistent with the rest of iOS7. It consisted of the white icon on top of a gradient with the purple colors featured heavily throughout the app and marketing material.

                                After logging in/signing up, the first thing a user would see would be the Search page, prepopulated with a search from the location they were currently in. The Search page's UI design was inspired by Yelp's and enables a user to search for Tour Guides in certain locations, presented as a list. The decision to present tour guides first thing was made because that was the primary (and perhaps, only) purpose of the app.
